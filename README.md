# Advent Of Code in Rust

[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles solved in Rust.

This is done as a way for me to become familiar with the Rust language.

Currently each challenge is a different cargo project with a function for the part 1 and another function for part 2.

The main repository is on Gitlab.com at https://gitlab.com/MateusRodCosta/adventofcode-rust.

A mirror is available on Github at https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/AdventOfCode-Rust.

## How to run

Open the desired cargo project, copy the input file inside the folder as `input.txt` and use `cargo run`.
